# CS 4980: Captstone Project - Overview

**Capstone Student:** Grady Hollar (vhe5ak@virginia.edu)

**Capstone Mentor:** Mark Floryan (mrf8t@virginia.edu)

## Goal and Deliverables

The goal of this capstone project is to study the theory and techniques of approximation algorithms with the dual purpose of deepening my own understanding and producing a self-contained, pedagogically clear technical writeup at the end of the semester. This writeup will serve as a reference for revamping the approximation algorithms module within the CS 4501: Advanced Algorithms course at UVA for future semesters.

The project will begin with a review of complexity theory and introductory approximation material, proceed through combinatorial and LP-based approximation algorithms, and conclude with hardness of approximation. The final deliverable will be a detailed, structured, pedagogy-conscious overview of approximation algorithms that clearly explains key algorithms, techniques, and theory in such a manner that, as previously stated, it may be used as a guide for constructing the new class module.

## Performance Criteria

The final deliverable will be evaluated on the following main criteria:

1. **Clarity:** The writeup is clear in its presentation of the material. Minimal outside sources should be needed to understand the topics presented.
2. **Technical Depth:** To a reasonable degree (see criteria 4.), the writeup provides a level of detail satisfactory for advanced undergraduate level learning.
3. **Technical Breadth:** The writeup gives a suitable overview of the world of approximation algorithms and does not leave out any key topics.
4. **Succinctness:** Without sacrificing criteria 2. and 3. to an unreasonable degree, the writeup should distill the information down enough so as to merit the design of course materials from the writeup.


## Tentative Schedule: (13 weeks, starting today)

### Week 1-2:
- Work through Cormen and Sipser + review from class. Goal is just to get a general overview.
- **Sources:** Cormen ch 35, Sipser ch 10.1, class slides

### Weeks 3-5:
- Combinatorial algorithms and usual techniques
- **Sources:** Vazirani ch 1-11, Williamson ch 1-3,

### Weeks 6-8:
- LP-based algorithms
- **Sources:** Vazirani ch 12-26, Williamson ch 4-8

### Weeks 9-11:
- Hardness of approximation
- **Sources:** Vazirani ch 29, Arora ch 18, Williamson ch 16, Hochbaum ch 10

### Weeks 12-13:
- Writeup + drafting
- Misc. fun stuff
    - How to whack moles
    - Code up some stuff?
    - Any topics I found interesting from before that I want to dive into more.
- **Sources** Jansen, anything I find that looks cool

## Sources:

### Primary:

### Vazirani - *Approximation Algorithms*

- Main text and structure to follow.

### Williamson + Shmoys - *The Design of Approximation Algorithms*

- Secondary main text to follow. Has sections that match up well with Vazirani as far as schedule goes

### Arora + Barak - *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach*

- Main reference for hardness of approximation. Even has a proof of PCP theorem.


### Secondary:

### Cormen - *Introduction to Algorithms*
- A starting point to learn/review some fundamental concepts + problems.

### Sipser - *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*
- Use for review/as a reference for fundamental computational/complexity theory topics
- Also has one chapter on approx. algos.

### Hochbaum - *Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems*

- A reference just to skip through and pick out some interesting problems to look at.
- Also has a good section on hardness of approximation.

### Jansen - *Approximation and Online Algorithms - First International Workshop*

- A collection of research level problems. Maybe good to look at for fun at the end of the semester. Specifically, there's a whole article about whack-a-mole, seems pretty awesome.
